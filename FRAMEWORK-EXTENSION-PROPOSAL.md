# Framework Extension Proposal: Universal Structured AI Workflows

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a proposal to extend snarktank's brilliant 3-file AI development workflow system into a universal framework supporting multiple business functions while maintaining the core pattern that makes it effective.

## 🎯 **Current State Analysis**

### **What Works (snarktank's original system):**
- ✅ **Clear 3-step process**: Create → Generate → Process
- ✅ **Iterative execution**: One task at a time with verification
- ✅ **AI-guided workflow**: Templates provide structure, AI provides intelligence
- ✅ **Proven effectiveness**: 3.5k stars, widespread adoption

### **Current Limitation:**
- 🔒 **Domain-specific**: Only works for product development/PRDs
- 🔒 **Single use case**: Cannot leverage pattern for other business functions

## 💡 **The Universal Pattern Recognition**

The core insight: snarktank created a **meta-framework** that works beyond just product development:

```
1. STRUCTURED CREATION → 2. INTELLIGENT BREAKDOWN → 3. ITERATIVE EXECUTION
   (Define requirements)    (Generate specific tasks)   (Execute with verification)
```

This pattern applies to **any structured workflow** across business functions.

## 🏗 **Proposed Repository Structure**
